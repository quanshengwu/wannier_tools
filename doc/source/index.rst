**Advertisement**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We already developed a tool to symmetrize Wannier tight binding models. It can symmetrize your wannier90_hr.dat which made of 
s, p, d and f orbitals. However, it is not released and under testing (The new version after May 10 2018 is more powerful and accurate).
If you want to use this part, plase contact one of our 
developers Changming Yue (yuechangming8 at gmail.com).  Before contacting him, please make sure that the Wannier functions you constructed should
are atomic-like orbitals. If you use random projectors in the Wannier90.win, we can't help you to symmetrize the Hamiltonian.
